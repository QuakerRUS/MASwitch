# Mouse Acceleration Switch

The utility performs:
* Disabling mouse acceleration without re-logging into the operating system.
* Periodically checks if the acceleration settings have changed, and then reapplies them.

Instructions for the fitting:
* Run the utility and read the text. We look at the "Current settings" parameter.
* Remember the parameter and write it down, when you run it, e.g. this: MASwitch 6 10 1
* To exit the utility and restore acceleration, press Esc.
* If the operation of the utility was interrupted not through Esc, to restore the settings, run the utility with the previous parameters and press Esc.
